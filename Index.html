        <p>Bear Grylls has always sought the ultimate in adventure. Growing up on a remote island off of Britain's
            windswept
            coast, he was taught by his father to sail and climb at an early age. Inevitably, it wasn't long before the
            young
            explorer was sneaking out to lead all-night climbing expeditions.
            As a teenager at Eton College, Bear found his identity and purpose through both mountaineering and martial
            arts.
            These passions led him into the foothills of the mighty Himalayas and to a karate grandmaster's remote
            training camp
            in Japan, an experience that soon helped him earn a second-degree black belt. Returning home, he embarked
            upon the
            notoriously grueling selection course for the British Special Forces to join the elite Special Air Service
            unit 21
            SASâ€”a journey that would push him to the very limits of physical and mental endurance.
            Then, disaster. Bear broke his back in three places in a horrific free-fall parachuting accident in Africa.
            It was
            touch and go whether he would walk again, according to doctors. However, only eighteen months later, a
            twenty-three-year-old Bear became one of the youngest climbers to scale Mount Everest, the world's highest
            summit.
            But this was just the beginning of his many extraordinary adventures. . . .
            Known and admired by millions as the star of Man vs. Wild, Bear Grylls has survived where few would dare to
            go. Now,
            for the first time, Bear tells the story of his action-packed life. Gripping, moving, and wildly
            exhilarating, Mud,
            Sweat, and Tears is a must-read for adrenaline junkies and armchair explorers alike.</p>
